# Peak Valley Detection

The `peakvalley` process provides automated detection of peaks and valleys in time-series data by analysing amplitude changes and slope patterns. It identifies significant drops, recoveries, and inflexion points to classify each time step as a peak, a valley, or a neutral state. 
This process is particularly useful for applications such as vegetation phenology monitoring, hydrological studies, and climate data analysis.
