# Normalized Difference Infrared Index

Calculate NDII for an area specifying collection and bands and/or time period.

This NDII index uses a normalized difference formulation index of wavelengths 819/1600 nm, 
which corresponds to bands B08 and B11 for Sentinel-2.
It is a reflectance measurement, sensitive to changes in water content of plant canopies.
The index values increase with increasing water content. Applications of NDII
include agricultural crop management, forest canopy monitoring, and stressed
vegetation detection.
