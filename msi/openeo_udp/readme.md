# Moisture Stress Index
Calculate MSI for an area specifying collection and bands and/or time period.

The MSI is a reflectance measurement, sensitive to increases in leaf water content.

As water content in vegetation canopy leaves increases, the absorbtion at wavelengths 
around 1599 nm also increases. Absorption at 819nm is used as a reference, 
since it’s nearly unaffected by changes in water content. Applications of the 
MSI include canopy stress analysis, productivity prediction and modelling, 
fire hazard analysis, and studies of ecosystem physiology. The index is 
inverted relative to the other water vegetation indices; higher values indicate 
greater water stress and less water content.
