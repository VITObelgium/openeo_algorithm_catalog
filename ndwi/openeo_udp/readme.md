# Normalized Difference Water Index

Calculate NDWI at 10m resolution, for an area specifying collection and bands and/or time period.

During drought event, vegetation canopy can be affected by water stress. This can have major
impact on the plant development in general and can cause crop failure or lower crop production in
agricultural areas. Early recognition of plant water stress can be critical to prevent such
consequences. By providing near-real time information on the plant water stress to the
stakeholders, water and agricultural management can be much improved, notably by irrigating
specifically areas where plant water needs are not fulfilled anymore.
The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is known to be strongly related to the plant water
content. It is therefore a very good proxy for plant water stress. 

NDWI is defined as the normalized difference between the NIR and SWIR bands.
